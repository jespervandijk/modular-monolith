## Solution Architecture

### Modular Monolith

- This solution follows the modular monolith architecture pattern.
- The Modules folder contains all the modules. Each module is an application that can become a microservice in the future if needed.
- Each module has its own bounded context.

### Clean Architecture

- Each module consists of multiple dotnet projects (csproj).
- Each module follows clean architecture for code sructure.
- Each module is divided into three main layers: Domain, Application, and Infrastructure.
- I skipped the presentation layer because in an api it mostly consists of endpoints. Endpoints I keep in my vertical slices.

## Domain Layer

- I follow DDD principles in the domain layer.

- **Aggregates:**
  - I have a folder called Aggregates inside the domain layer. This folder has nested folders for each aggregate root. Inside these folders I put the aggregate root entity, related entities and value objects.
- **Entities:**
  - For entities I use classes.
  - Every Entity has an Id property. This property uses a value object as type. Under the hood this value object wraps a guid.
  - Aggregate roots have properties with private setters. If we want to write to an aggregate it should alwys be done through methods on the aggregate root entity itself.
  - Other entities in the aggregate can have properties with internal setters. This way only code inside the domain layer can write to these entities. Its not perfect because all aggregates are in the same assembly. But its better than public setters.
  - For collection properties I use IReadOnlyList<T> as type. The backing field is a List<T>. This way the collections are immutable from outside the aggregate.
- **Value Objects:**
  - For single value objects I use the packahge Vogen.
  - For value objects with multiple properties I use records.
  - Value objects that use records have init only properties. This way value objects are immutable.
- **Domain Services:**
  - If we need to write to one aggregate and we need data from another aggregate to do so, we use a domain service.
  - Domain services are stateless services that contain domain logic that doesn't fit into an aggregate.
- **Factories:**
  - If the creation of an aggregate needs another aggregate I use a factory class.
  - Factories are static classes with static methods that create aggregates.
  - If the creation of an aggregate doesn't need another aggregate I use a static method on the aggregate root entity itself.

## Application Layer

### Use Cases:

- The most important part of the application layer are the use cases.
- Each use case file contains multiple classes and records that work together to fullfil the use case. I also refer to these files as vertical slices.
- Every use case is either a command or a query.

- **Endpoint:**
  - every use case has an endpoint class. This class inhertis from a base endpoint class that comes from the package FastEndpoints. There are multiple variants of this base class depending on the needs of the endpoint.
- **Command and Command Handler:**
  - A command use case has a record that implements ICommand from FastEndpoints. This record represents the request dto.
  - A command use case also has a class that implements ICommandHandler<T> from FastEndpoints. This class contains the business logic for handling the command.
- **Query:**
  - A query use case has a record that is the request dto.
  - A query use case handles the request inside the endpoint class directly. There is no separate handler class for queries.
- **Validator:**
  - Both command and query use cases have a validator class that inherits from Validator<T> class from FastEndpoints. This package uses FluentValidation under the hood.
  - I dont want authorization checks or database calls in my validators. So keep the validation logic simple.
  - NOTE: if you need to use scoped services inside the validator. You need to resolve them directly inside the rule using Resolve<>() method.

### Abstractions in Application Layer

- The application layer also contains interfaces for repositories. These interfaces are implemented in the infrastructure layer.
- The application layer also contains interfaces for a unit of work. This interface is implemented in the infrastructure layer.
- The application layer also contains a Dtos folder. This folder contains dto records that are used in endpoint responses.
- I dont use dtos for all data in request and reponse objects. I only use dtos for entities. For value objects I use the value objects directly in request and response objects.
- The application layer also has a UsercContext service. This service provides information about the currently authenticated user.

## Infrastructure Layer

- The infrastructure layer contains implementations for repositories.
- The repositories all inherit from a generic repository base class.
- The infrastructure layer also contains a unit of work implementation. This repositories don't save anything until the unit of work's SaveChangesAsync method is called.
- The repositories and unit of work use MartenDb under the hood.
- I use martenDb as document database.

## Examples in this Solution

- CreateCourse.cs is a perfect example of a command use case. This use case is part of the AcademicManagement module.
- GetCourses.cs is a perfect example of a query use case. This use case is part of the AcademicManagement module.

## The Academic Domain

- This solution has multiple modules. They are all about the academic domain.
- The project is an example to understand the modular monolith architecture pattern, clean architecture and DDD principles and vertical slices.
- The modules are:
  - AcademicManagement: Its used by presidents of universities and professors to manage courses.
  - StudentEnrollment: Its used by students to enroll in courses.
